# Rotary Inverted Pendulum

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a **Rotary Inverted Pendulum**.  
The system balances a free-swinging pendulum on a rotary arm using a **NEMA 17 stepper motor** and a **high-resolution rotary encoder**.

The project features:
- A custom **Swing-Up algorithm (Energy Shaping)**
- A **PID / LQR Controller**
- Runs on an **Arduino Mega 2560**

# 🚀 Features

- **Auto-Swing Up** — Pumps energy into the pendulum to lift it to upright.
- **PID Stabilization** — Smooth balancing with PID control.
- **High-Speed Stepper Control** — Direct port manipulation + interrupts (40k+ steps/sec).
- **Safety Cutoff** — Driver disables if pendulum falls to prevent overheating.

# 🔌 Wiring & Connections (Arduino Mega)

## **1. Stepper Motor Driver (A4988 / DRV8825)**

| Driver Pin | Arduino Pin | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| STEP      | Pin 5       | Step pulse signal |
| DIR       | Pin 6       | Direction signal |
| SLEEP     | Pin 8       | Sleep mode control (Active High) |
| RESET     | Pin 9       | Reset control (Active High) |
| VMOT      | Ext. 12V +  | Motor power |
| GND       | Ext. 12V −  | Motor power ground (common ground required) |
| VDD       | 5V          | Logic power |
| GND       | GND         | Logic ground |
| 1A/1B     | —           | Stepper Motor Coil A |
| 2A/2B     | —           | Stepper Motor Coil B |

## **2. Rotary Encoder**

> Pins 2 and 3 correspond to **Port E** on the ATmega2560 for fast port access.

| Encoder Wire | Arduino Pin | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Phase A (Green) | Pin 2 | Interrupt pin — use 4.7kΩ pull-up |
| Phase B (White) | Pin 3 | Interrupt pin — use 4.7kΩ pull-up |
| VCC (Red)       | 5V    | Encoder power |
| GND (Black)     | GND   | Encoder ground |

# 🔍 Noise Reduction (Recommended)

To prevent jitter or false readings:

- Connect **4.7kΩ** resistor between Pin **2 → 5V**
- Connect **4.7kΩ** resistor between Pin **3 → 5V**
